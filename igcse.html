    <h1>Booking systems</h1>
    Online booking systems rely on the ability to update files immediately,<br>
    thus preventing double-booking, which could happen if the system response<br>
    time was slow.<br>
    Online booking systems are used in:<br>
<ul>
    <li>the travel industry</li>
    <li>for concerts (theatre and music events)</li>
    <li>for cinema tickets</li>
    <li>when booking sporting events.</li>
</ul>
 
Before we start looking at specific examples, it is worth considering some of<br> 
the advantages and disadvantages of using online booking systems.<br>
    <b>Advantages</b>
    <ul>
        <li>They prevent double-booking.</li>
        <li>The customer gets immediate feedback on the availability of seats and <br>
        whether or not their booking has been successful.</li>
        <li>The customer can make bookings at any time of the day.</li>
        <li> The customer's email allows the booking company to connect 'special offers'<br> 
        to their email and inform them of such offers automatically.</li>
        <li>It is usually easier to browse the seating plans (particularly on flights) to choose<br> 
        the best seats available at the price.</li>
        <li>It is possible to 'reserve' a seat for a period of time this allows a customer to 'make up<br> 
        their mind' before finalising the booking of the seat (this was difficult to do with the<br>
        older paper-based systems).</li>
        <li>Very often there are no printed tickets, which saves postal costs and also allows <br>
        'impulse' bookings only a few hours in advance.</li>
        <li>Online booking allows the use of modern smartphone and tablet Apps technology;<br>
        the customer is sent a QR code which contains all the booking information<br>
        necessary (this QR code is stored on the smartphone or tablet and only needs to<br>
        be scanned at, for example, the theatre or airport on arrival).</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Disadvantages</b>
    <ul>
        <li>The setting up and maintenance of online booking systems is expensive.</li>
        <li>All customers using this service need access to a computer or mobile<br>
        phone and a reliable internet connection.</li>
        <li>It is often more difficult to cancel the booking and get your money back <br>
        using online systems.</li>
        <li>If the server is down for maintenance, or if the systems breaks down,<br>
        it becomes impossible to book seats by any method (temporary paper-based <br>
        systems cannot be used in case of the risk of double-booking occurring).</li>
        <li> If the websites are not well designed, it can be difficult to make<br>
        exactly the booking you want or can lead you to make mistakes; this is a<br>
        particular issue with flight bookings where correcting an error can cost<br>
        the customer an additional fee.</li>
        <li>Booking online does not allow you to build a personal relationship with<br>
        a travel agent who might offer free upgrades or special offers which may<br>
        not be available to online bookings.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>The travel industry</b>
    As an example, we will consider booking a flight online. A form similar to the one shown<br>
    in Figure 6.17 would appear on the screen. The user only needs to fill in the appropriate<br>
    fields and the system will automatically search for available flights, make bookings and <br>
    transfer the funds from their bank account. Unless something goes wrong, there will be no <br>
    need to talk to a human operator at any stage of the booking process.<br>

    <b>Events such as concerts, theatres and cinemas</b>
    We will now consider the online booking system when trying to book a concert, theatre<br>
    or cinema performance. Because all three examples involve booking seats inside a<br>
    building fitted with seats, we will use the same booking system for all three. With<br>
    the example chosen, we have assumed that the customer has already logged on to the<br>
    events booking website (and the event is a music concert at a seated venue).<br>
    <img src="imagen2.png"/>
    <ol>
        <li>The customer clicks on the performance they wish to see.</li>
        <li>A date and time is typed in.</li>
        <li>The required number of seats is also entered.</li>
        <li>The seating display at the venue is shown on the screen.</li>
        <li>The user selects their seat(s) by highlighting the actual seats on the<br>
        screen display and then clicks CONFIRM to go to the next part of the process.</li>
        <li>The database is then searched to check the availability of the selected seats.</li>
        <li>If the seats are available, the total price is shown plus the seat<br>
        numbers; this shows on another screen on the web page.</li>
        <li>If the customer is happy with this, they select CONFIRM on the screen.</li>
        <li>The seats are now temporarily held and set by the system as NO LONGER<br>
        AVAILABLE - this stops anyone else from booking them.</li>
        <li>The customer then enters their personal details or indicates<br>
        that they are a returning customer (in which case the website being<br>
        used will already have their details).</li>
        <li>Payment method is then selected and payment made.</li>
        <li>The theatre seats are then booked in the customer's name.</li>
        <li>The final details are again shown on the screen.</li>
        <li>An email is sent to the customer which may contain a QR code<br>
        which contains all their booking details (this acts as their e-ticket);<br>
        the QR code is then scanned at the venue.</li>
        <li>The database is finally updated with the booking transaction and<br>
        the seats are permanently confirmed as no longer available.</li>
    </ol>
    <b>Booking sporting events</b>
    Booking a sporting event is very similar to the example above. Again, depending<br>
    on the event, the online booking system will show a seating plan.<br>
    <img src="imagen3.png"/><br>
    The customer will need to select the event, the required day(s), number of<br>
    people and preferred seats. Because the seats are often sold in blocks, the<br>
    database will be searched to see if there are any seats available on the chosen<br>
    date. Available seats will not show on the booking map, which is different to<br>
    the concert/cinema booking system. If there is availability, the customer will<br>
    be offered seats in the block. If the customer is happy with the option, they<br>
    simply confirm the booking and payment is made online. Confirmation will be sent<br>
    via email and/or possibly a QR code, which can be downloaded to the customer's<br>
    smartphone; this QR code will act as their event ticket(s). Some sporting events<br>
    do not book seats (such as a golf tournament) in which case the booking will simply<br>
    be entry to the event.<br>
    The advantages and disadvantages of booking sports events online are the same as for<br>
    online booking of concert and cinema tickets.<br>
    One additional feature often offered with sporting events, is the ability to also<br>
    book flights and hotels if the event takes place overseas.<br>
